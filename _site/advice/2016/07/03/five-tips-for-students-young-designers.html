    <h2 id="develop-an-online-presence">1. Develop an online presence</h2>

<p>This is <strong>the</strong> most important piece of advice I can give you. Get yourself and your work online.</p>

<p>When I get your CV the first thing I’m going to look for is your website. It also helps to have your own personal email address. An address like you@yourwebsite.com is going to make you look like the real deal, topbantz69@gmail.com (apologies if that’s you) isn’t.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website or social media channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leave positive and constructive comments on blog posts</li>
  <li>If you’re a developer, posts answers on Stack Overflow</li>
  <li>Post your work on Behance, Dribbble and Pinterest</li>
  <li>Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen</li>
  <li>Create public GitHub repo where I can see your code</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to see the kind of work you create, the kind of blogs you read and the kind of people you follow.</p>

<h2 id="focus---you-cannot-know-everything">2. Focus - you cannot know everything</h2>

<p>Job descriptions can be daunting and comprehensive. Having written a couple myself, it’s tempting to target the perfect multi-disciplined designer who can do everything.</p>

<p>Agencies may fill up the job description with every skill in the book, but in reality your role will be specific to only a small amount. Specialise and become an expert in a few areas.</p>

<h2 id="network">3. Network</h2>

<p>There are agencies everywhere and they’re only an email away.</p>

<h2 id="get-some-kit">3. Get some kit</h2>

<p>Easier said than done. But having your own kit will help you greatly and if it’s a laptop, even better. You may need to take it with you to freelance gigs, meetings and (hopefully) interviews.</p>

<p>If you’re doing some freelance work in studio, it’s likely that most agencies will have a machine for you. But being pro-active and offering to bring your own kit will open up a few doors at the smaller agencies.</p>

<h2 id="keep-in-contact-with-local-agencies">5. Keep in contact with local agencies</h2>
