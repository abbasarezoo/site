Here’s something you may already know: getting a gig in the design industry is difficult. It’s a crowded market with employers looking for multi-disciplined creatives and standing out from the crowd can be difficult. At Vivid, we actively encourage applications and enquiries from students and graduates. Here’s a few tips on how get to get your foot in the door.

## 1. Develop an online presence

This is **the** most important piece of advice I can give you. It’s essential to get yourself and your work online, this is where we go to first when we receive applications. Getting online may require a small investment on your part, but if it gets you a job it’ll be worth it. 

If you’re not a developer, services like Squarespace and Wix can make the whole process a breeze. If you are a developer, you should absolutely develop your own site. Experience counts for a lot and the more sites you build the better.

It also helps to have your own professional email address. An address like topbantz69@gmail.com might have felt like a good idea at the time, but it isn’t a great look when applying for jobs.

There’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website, here’s a few:

### Designers:

- Post your work on Behance, Tumblr, Dribbble and Pinterest
- Share your work with friends on Facebook
- Create a PDF version of your portfolio - keep the file size low enough to email

### Developers:

- Contribute to the web community on Stack Overflow and Quora
- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Create public GitHub repo where I can see your code

### Everybody:

- Follow and interact with industry experts on Twitter
- Leave constructive comments on articles and blog posts
- Don’t be insulting content you add to websites can be indexed on Google

## 2. Brand yourself

How you look is going to make an impression with clients and employers, good or bad.

If you’ve followed step one you will probably know it’s a good idea to come up with some brand assets for yourself. Paying careful attention to your public facing content and any correspondence you send to potential clients and employers is absolutely key. 

Don’t forget, successfully branding yourself should be considered as a portfolio piece. You should be able to talk confidently about why and how you have branded yourself.

### Key things to remember:

- Create a digital letterhead: Great for sending covering letters and proposals via emails
- Build an email signature: Keep it simple, your name, logo, website and social media links will do
- Be consistent - keep fonts, icons, colours, image treatments and type consistent across all media

## 3. Focus on your strengths

Job descriptions can be daunting and comprehensive. Having written a couple myself, it's tempting to target the perfect multi-disciplined designer who can do everything. 

Agencies may fill up the job description with every skill in the book, but that’s not normally the reality in agency life. Specialise and become an expert in a few areas. 

If you’ve studied computer science and are looking for a career in Ruby development then focus on that. Don’t waste your time trying to level up your CSS skills. If you’re obsessed with print, inks, paper stocks and Pantone books then stay in that world. There is time to develop your skill set as your career progresses.

If you promote yourself as an all-knowing design hero we will question you on it and make you prove yourself. So be wary!

## 4. Get some kit

Having your own hardware is a must and if it's a laptop, even better. You may need to take it with you to freelance gigs, meetings and (hopefully) interviews. 

If you're doing freelance work for an agency, it's likely that most agencies will have a machine for you. But being pro-active and offering to bring your own kit will open up a few doors at the smaller agencies.

It’s very tempting to drop your life savings on a MacBook, but don’t forget that you can get a very powerful Windows laptop for a quarter of the price. Leaving you plenty of budget for things like software, wireless peripherals, business cards and coffee. 

I won’t lie, the design industry is be very snobbish about hardware, especially Apple kit. Don’t be put off by this, I worked on a Windows machine in my previous job and it was great. If you work is good, it doesn’t matter what machine you did it on.

However… you **must** be using or have the ability to use industry standard software. This means a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. This will require a investment on your part. Don’t forget, if you’re still in college or University you can take advantage of Adobe’s favourable student rates.


## 5. Keep in contact with local agencies

## 6. Prepare to be critiqued
