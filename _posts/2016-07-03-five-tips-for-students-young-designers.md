## 1. Develop an online presence

This is **the** most important piece of advice I can give you. It’s essential to get yourself and your work online. This will involve a small investment on your part, but if it gets you a job it’ll be worth it.

It also helps to have your own professional email address. An address like you@yourwebsite.com is going to make you look like the real deal, topbantz69@gmail.com isn’t… apologies if that’s you.

Beyond this, there’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website or social media channels:

- Leave positive and constructive comments on blog posts
- If you’re a developer, posts answers on Stack Overflow
- Post your work on Behance, Dribbble and Pinterest
- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Create public GitHub repo where I can see your code

I want to see the kind of work you create, the kind of blogs you read and the kind of people you follow.

## 2. Focus - you cannot know everything

Job descriptions can be daunting and comprehensive. Having written a couple myself, it's tempting to target the perfect multi-disciplined designer who can do everything. 

Agencies may fill up the job description with every skill in the book, but in reality your role will be specific to only a small amount. Specialise and become an expert in a few areas.

## 3. Network

There are agencies everywhere and they're only an email away. 

## 3. Get some kit

Easier said than done. But having your own kit will help you greatly and if it's a laptop, even better. You may need to take it with you to freelance gigs, meetings and (hopefully) interviews. 

If you're doing some freelance work in studio, it's likely that most agencies will have a machine for you. But being pro-active and offering to bring your own kit will open up a few doors at the smaller agencies.

## 5. Keep in contact with local agencies
