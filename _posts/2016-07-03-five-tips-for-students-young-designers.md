Here’s something you may already know: getting a gig in the design industry is difficult. It’s a crowded market with employers looking for multi-disciplined creatives and standing out from the crowd can be difficult. At Vivid, we actively encourage applications and enquiries from students, graduates and designers who are new to the game. So if that's you, here’s a few tips on how get to get your foot in the door.

## 1. Get some kit

Having your own hardware is a great idea. If it's a laptop, even better. You might need to take it with you to freelance gigs, meetings, presentations and interviews.

If you're doing freelance work for an agency or an in-house team, it's highly likely that they will have a machine for you. But being able bring your own gear will definitely open up a few doors at smaller agencies and businesses.

### Thinking different

While developers tend to go with non-Mac options, designers traditionally go with Apple hardware. But if you're new to the game, money might be tight. You could get a MacBook, or you could get a very powerful Windows laptop for a quarter of the price. 

> Spoiler alert: designing on a PC is no different to designing on a Mac. Design studios use Macs based on nothing other than tradition. Yes, there was a time when Macs were more suited for designing with, but those days are long gone.

It's down to you be intelligent about your budget. The difference between the price of Apple hardware and the alternatives is well documented. This difference could leave you plenty of budget for important things like software, wireless peripherals, business cards, travel and booze (optional).

### Industry standards 

You **must** be have access to industry standard software. If you’re developer, you’re lucky, most code editors are reasonably priced and some like [GitHub’s Atom editor](https://atom.io/) are free. 

Designers: a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud is required - so this means spending some cash. But don’t forget, if you’re still in college or University you can take advantage of Adobe’s favourable student rates. Investing in software may seem daunting but it’s a must for any aspiring designer.

> You could grab older versions of Adobe Creative Suite from eBay for a reasonable price if you cannot stomach the monthly subscription fee for Creative Cloud.

## 2. Develop an online presence

It’s essential to get yourself and your work online, this is where we go to first when we receive applications. Getting online may require a small investment on your part and may seem a little daunting, but if it gets you a job it’s be worth it.

### Small investments, large payoffs

Services like Squarespace and Wix can make the whole process a breeze if you’ve never written a line of code before. If you are a developer, you should absolutely develop your own site, I’ll see that as a weak spot if you didn’t. We will be looking at your source code so keep it clean.

It also helps to have your own professional email address. An address like topbantz69@gmail.com might have felt like a good idea at the time, but it isn’t a great look when applying for jobs. Your email address and your phone number are your two main points of contact. You can’t easily choose a nice looking phone number, but you can control the look of your email address.

### Shout it from the rooftops

There are a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website. Here’s a few for starters:

#### Designers:

- Post your work on Behance, Tumblr, Dribbble and Pinterest
- Share your work with friends on Facebook
- Create a PDF version of your portfolio and keep the file size low enough to email. Add a link to it on your website (see step #2)

#### Developers:

- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Create public GitHub repo where we can see your code
- Contribute to the web community on Stack Overflow and Quora

#### Everybody:

- Follow and interact with industry experts on Twitter
- Leave constructive comments on articles and blog posts
- Don’t be insulting - content you add to websites can be indexed on Google

## 3. Brand yourself

How you look is going to make an impression with clients and employers, good or bad.

If you’ve followed step #2 you will probably know it’s a good idea to come up with some brand assets for yourself. Paying careful attention to your public facing content and any correspondence you send to potential clients and employers is absolutely key. 

Don’t forget, successfully branding yourself should be considered as a portfolio piece. You should be able to talk confidently about why and how you have branded yourself.

### Key things to remember:

- Create a digital letterhead: Great for sending covering letters and proposals via emails
- Build an email signature: Keep it simple, your name, logo, website and social media links will do
- Be consistent - keep fonts, icons, colours, image treatments and type consistent across all media

## 4. Focus on your strengths

Job descriptions can be daunting and comprehensive. Having written a couple myself, it's tempting to target the perfect multi-disciplined designer who can do everything. 

Agencies may fill up the job description with every skill in the book, but that’s not normally the reality in agency life. Specialise and become an expert in a few areas. 

If you’ve studied computer science and are looking for a career in Ruby development then focus on that. Don’t waste your time trying to level up your CSS skills. If you’re obsessed with print, inks, paper stocks and Pantone books then stay in that world. There is time to develop your skill set as your career progresses.

If you promote yourself as an all-knowing design hero we will question you on it so be ready.
