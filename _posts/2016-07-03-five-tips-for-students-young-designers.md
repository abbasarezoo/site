Here’s something you may already know: getting a gig in the design industry is difficult. It’s a crowded market with employers looking for multi-disciplined creatives and standing out from the crowd can be difficult. At Vivid, we actively encourage applications and enquiries from students and graduates. Here’s a few tips on how get to get your foot in the door.

## 1. Develop an online presence

This is **the** most important piece of advice I can give you. It’s essential to get yourself and your work online, this is where we go to first when we receive applications. Getting online may require a small investment on your part, but if it gets you a job it’ll be worth it. 

The good news is you don’t need to be a web developer to build your own personal site. There are several services that make the whole process a breeze such as Squarespace and Wix. If you are a developer, you should absolutely develop your own site. Experience counts for a lot and the more sites you build the better.

It also helps to have your own professional email address. An address like topbantz69@gmail.com might have felt like a good idea at the time, but it isn’t a great look when applying for jobs.

Beyond this, there’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website:

### Designers:

- Post your work on Behance, Tumblr, Dribbble and Pinterest
- Share your work with friends on Facebook
- Create a PDF version of your portfolio - keep the file size low enough to email

### Developers:

- Contribute to the web community on Stack Overflow and Quora
- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Create public GitHub repo where I can see your code

### Both:

- Follow and interact with industry experts on Twitter
- Leave constructive comments on blog posts
- Don’t be insulting, comments and posts can be indexed on Google

I want to see the kind of work you create, the kind of blogs you read and the kind of people you follow.

## 2. Focus - you cannot know everything

Job descriptions can be daunting and comprehensive. Having written a couple myself, it's tempting to target the perfect multi-disciplined designer who can do everything. 

Agencies may fill up the job description with every skill in the book, but in reality your role will be specific to only a small amount. Specialise and become an expert in a few areas.

## 3. Network

There are agencies everywhere and they're only an email away. 

## 3. Get some kit

Easier said than done. But having your own kit will help you greatly and if it's a laptop, even better. You may need to take it with you to freelance gigs, meetings and (hopefully) interviews. 

If you're doing some freelance work in studio, it's likely that most agencies will have a machine for you. But being pro-active and offering to bring your own kit will open up a few doors at the smaller agencies.

## 5. Keep in contact with local agencies
