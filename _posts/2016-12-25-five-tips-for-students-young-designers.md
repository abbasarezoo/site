## 1. Develop an online presence

This is **the** most important piece of advice I can give you. Get yourself and your work online. When I get your CV the first thing I’m going to look for is your website. It also helps to have your own personal email address. An address like you@yourwebsite.com is going to make you look like the real deal, topbantz69@gmail.com (apologies if that’s you) isn’t.

Beyond that, there’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website or social media channels:

- Leave positive and constructive comments on blog posts. Don’t forget to include a link to your website and/or your Twitter if the site lets you.
- If you’re a developer, give answers on Stack Overflow 
- Post your work on Behance
- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Have a public GitHub repo where I can see your code

I want to see the kind of work you create and the kind of people you follow.

## 2. Give yourself an identity

## 3. Go freelance

## 4. Focus - you cannot know everything

Those job descriptions requiring knowledge of every coding language under the sun are misleading. In reality most designers use a handful of apps.

## 5. Keep in contact with local agencies
