## 1. Develop an online presence - create a website, show your work.

Most important.

There’s a ton of free ways to promote yourself online beyond your own website or social media channels:

- Comment on blog posts
- Give answers on Stack Overflow
- Post your work on Behance
- Create prototypes and experiments on CodePen
- Have a public GitHub repo where I can see your code

I want to see the kind of work you create and the kind of people you follow. I’d be more put off by any derogatory comments on blog posts than pictures of you and the girls/lads out on the lash.

## 2. Give yourself an identity

## 3. Go freelance

## 4. Focus - you cannot know everything

Those job descriptions requiring knowledge of every coding language under the sun are misleading. In reality most designers use a handful of apps.

## 5. Keep in contact with local agencies
